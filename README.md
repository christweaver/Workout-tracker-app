## SwoleMate
Welcome to my workout tracker app! This application, built with Next.js, allows users to track their workouts effectively. It incorporates NextAuth for user authentication and MongoDB for database management, enabling users to create, edit, and delete workouts. Users can also view all their previously added workouts upon signing in. Additionally, the app provides options for users to select specific body regions and difficulty level. After making these selections, the application generates a randomized set of exercises for the user to engage with, offering a diverse array of workout options.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
