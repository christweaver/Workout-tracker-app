## SwoleMate
Welcome to my workout tracker app! This application, built with Next.js, allows users to track their workouts effectively. It incorporates NextAuth for user authentication and MongoDB for database management, enabling users to create, edit, and delete workouts. Users can also view all their previously added workouts upon signing in. Additionally, the app provides options for users to select specific body regions and difficulty level. After making these selections, the application generates a randomized set of exercises for the user to engage with, offering a diverse array of workout options.
